This playbook is no longer being up dated. Please refer to my homelab playbook for updates.

#ansible-pull

This is a generic version of my Ansible Pull playbook for setting up and restoring systems in my home lab.  If you want to use it, please review each section and update it to your needs.  Pay special attention to the areas with [BRACKETS].  You will need to replace that text with your personal settings.

If you have questions, please let me know and I will do my best to assist.
